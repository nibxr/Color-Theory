   <p>Blue has been an integral part of the art world for centuries, with its presence spanning diverse cultures and artistic movements. From the deep blue backgrounds in Renaissance masterpieces, like Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," to the swirling blues in Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night," artists have harnessed the emotional depth and symbolism of blue to convey moods, from melancholy to inspiration. Picasso's "Blue Period" showcased the color's power to express sorrow and introspection. Moreover, abstract artists like Mark Rothko used blue to evoke contemplation and spirituality. Blue continues to be a canvas for artistic expression, resonating with artists and viewers alike.</p>
